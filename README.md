# GDA_Bellabeat_Capstone
Good Data Analytics Capstone Project
---

This repository contains a data analysis project done for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course offered on Coursera. In this case study, I used data from a fictional high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, Bellabeat. R was chosen for the analysis and visualizations in order to improve upon skills. The goal was to identify trends amongst users and products to guide the marketing strategy with recommendations that could provide the company with opportunities for growth. With such insights, I was able to deliver recommendations, with which the company has developed a marketing campaign aimed at increasing feature usage and the potential for a new integrated product line.
