Good Data Analytics Capstone Project

This repository contains a data analysis project done for the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course offered on Coursera. In this case study, I used data from a fictional a fiction high-tech manufacturer of helath-focused products for women, Bellabeat. R was chosen for the analysis and visualizations in order to improve upon skills. The goal was to identify trends amongst users and products to guide the marketing strategy with recommendations that could provide new growth oppurtunities for the company.  With such insights, I was able to deliver recommendations, with which the company has developed a marketing campaign aimed at increasing feature usage and the potential for a new integrated product line.
